This task was based on predicting the price of the car based on the different parameters/features that were provided in the dataset.
As the task was to predict the continuous value of the target variable , I have used linear regression  to train the midel which can predict the price of the car .
Also using the evaluation metrics , the accuracy of predicting the car prices was very high.
Using various visualization libraries  like matplotlib, seaborn , visualized the data and the relation between the varibales provide in the dataset.
